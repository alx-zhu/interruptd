# Key Questions:

1. How to calculate the interest level, what are the thresholds?
2. How do I add dependency between front and backend? Ex: hitting an endpoint could show interest in where that endpoint is called, but it often doesn't come in the form of an import statement

# Ideas:

1. Only show files with high interest/mid or higher interest, etc (hide the files that are not interesting enough)
2. Track interest on a function-level
